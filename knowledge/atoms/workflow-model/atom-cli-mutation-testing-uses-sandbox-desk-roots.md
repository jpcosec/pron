# CLI mutation testing uses sandbox desk roots

## Answer

When testing or exploring mutating deskops CLI commands, agents should point writes at a disposable sandbox root such as `.tmp/deskops-cli-test` instead of the repository's real `desk/`. This keeps generated tasks, routines, primitives, inbox notes, and other workflow artifacts out of tracked project surfaces unless the mutation is intentionally changing the real desk.
